# Phase 1: Alignment (Problem Space)

**Goal:** Ensure we are solving the right problem.
**Output:** A clear GitHub Issue defining the **Problem** and **Goal**.

## 1. The Firewall
**Rule:** Do not be a "Yes Man". Clarify before acting.

## 2. Problem Exploration
Explore the "Idea Space" of the *problem* itself.
*   **What** are we trying to achieve?
*   **Why** is this valuable?
*   **Is it a good idea?** Challenge the premise. Could we solve this simply by *removing* something?
*   **Ambiguity Check:**
    *   **Low:** State assumptions explicitly.
    *   **High:** Ask targeted questions. Wait for user validation.

## 3. Contract
Document the agreed **Problem Statement** and **Success Criteria** in a GitHub Issue (`gh issue create`).
*   *Do not discuss architecture yet.* Focus on the user need.
