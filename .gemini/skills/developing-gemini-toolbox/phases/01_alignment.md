# Phase 1: Alignment (Problem Space)

**Goal:** Ensure we are solving the right problem.
**Output:** A clear GitHub Issue defining the **Problem** and **Goal**.

## 1. The Firewall
**Rule:** Do not be a "Yes Man". Clarify before acting.
👉 **See [Core Mandates](../references/mandates.md)** for the strict Ambiguity Handling Protocol.

## 2. Problem Exploration
Explore the "Idea Space" of the *problem* itself.
*   **What** are we trying to achieve?
*   **Why** is this valuable?
*   **Is it a good idea?** Challenge the premise.
*   **Ambiguity Check:** Apply the protocol from `references/mandates.md`.

## 3. Contract (The Output)
1.  **Synthesize:** Summarize the Problem Statement and Success Criteria.
2.  **Document:** Post this synthesis **as a comment** on the GitHub Issue (or create the issue if missing).
    *   *Constraint:* Do not proceed to Architecture until the goal is clear.
